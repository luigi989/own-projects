- Popup next/before entry button in popup
- Entry search (search through database and show that on website)
- Filter categories (gods, creatures, lore), maybe even more categories
- If an image is missing the visual becomes messed up 
        (Can it even be like that? React throws error)
- Better server-side messages
- Better descriptions in markdown files on Git

/ Close-button at bottom of popup
/ Click outside popup should close popup
/ Entries are loaded from database on startup
/ Popup appears at top of screen even if scrolled down
