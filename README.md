A repo where I house all my own little side-project. Planning to store webpages, small programs and more here. The languages used will be HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java and more.

## :microscope: Periodiska systemet

A complete website with an overview over the periodic table. You can interact with each element in the table. 

## :zap: Ragnarok

Ongoing project. A website used to show information about nordic gods and lore. Originally coded in HTML and CSS. Cause of language restrictations, a switch to React will happen.
